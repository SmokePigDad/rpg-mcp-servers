# MCP Server Tools & API Reference

This document provides a complete reference for all Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools available in the World of Darkness server suite. These tools are the building blocks for all game mechanics, character management, and chronicle progression.

## üìÅ Server Architecture

The system uses a two-server model:

* **`game-state-server`**: Manages persistent data, including character sheets, NPC records, inventory, experience, and world state. It is the "source of truth" for the chronicle.
* **`combat-engine-server`**: A stateless server that handles the game's dice mechanics and rule adjudications, such as rolling dice pools, resolving contested actions, and applying game-line-specific rules (e.g., Frenzy, Magick, Cantrips).

## üóÑÔ∏è `game-state-server` Tools

This server handles the "state" of your characters and the world.

- If `defender_difficulty` is missing/invalid:  
  `Error: 'defender_difficulty' is required and must be a number.`

    }
  ]
}
```

### Handler Validation & Error Style Audit

- All handlers now validate required arguments up front and return explicit error messages for missing/invalid arguments. 
- Standard error response: `{ "content": [ "‚ùå <explanation>" ], isError: true }` (‚ùå or similar icon).
- Field names in documentation match precisely the query and database layer for each tool.
- Error messages are actionable, tied to field context, and use consistent iconography and explanatory phrasing.
- Dice/engine server tools return `"Error: ..."` in responses for validation failures (as per code).
- Successes always use a positive icon (‚úÖ or formatted content block) with updated details.

If you see any deviation, please report for update, but as of this revision, the documentation and handler validation are tightly coupled.
