## Test Execution Summary

### Overall Results:
- **Total Tests**: 121
- **Passed**: 5 (4%)
- **Failed**: 116 (96%)
- **Partial**: 0 (0%)

### Test Block Results:
- Block 1 (Character Management): 0/21 passed
- Block 2 (Resources & Progression): 0/26 passed  
- Block 3 (Status Effects & Inventory): 0/30 passed
- Block 4 (Dice Mechanics): 5/36 passed (dice pool, specialty, chance die, contested, soak; all others blocked)
- Block 5 (World State & Initiative): 0/8 passed (initiative roll only; blocked by handler gaps)

### Critical Issues Found:
- MCP tool handlers for foundational character, resource, inventory, and world state operations are missing from game-state-server dispatcher, blocking 95%+ tests.
- Only dice rolling and contest resolution tools in combat-engine-server are reliably functional.
- Cross-server delegation for combat/initiative is not executable due to missing endpoints.
- Data persistence, CRUD, and world integration features could not be validated.

### Recommendations:
- **Implement and register all MCP tool handlers for CRUD/state in game-state-server, exactly matching tools in `toolDefinitions`.**
- Ensure dispatcher logic routes each tool to its corresponding handler.
- Verify end-to-end integration after implementing handlers, focusing on cross-server and persistence operations.
- Re-run the full QA suite after fixing dispatcher registration and re-enable tests for all validation, update, and persistence cases.

### Executive Assessment â€“ Production Readiness
- **System is not production-ready.** Core gameplay (character, antagonist, inventory, world state) and all data operations are nonfunctional.
- Dice/rule adjudication services in `combat-engine-server` are operational and can be used for mechanical simulation and basic testing only.
- Critical action: Complete wiring of game-state-server's tool dispatcher to support all required tools before production deployment.
