## PART 4: Initiative & Turn Management

### ❌ Blocked: Antagonist Re-Creation Fails on DB Unique Constraint

- Attempted to create antagonist "Rocco" (for use in initiative and turn cycle tests).
- MCP response: `UNIQUE constraint failed: character_abilities.character_id, character_abilities.ability_name`
- Database reports no antagonists found (`list_antagonists`), but cannot insert due to lingering data.
- Root cause: Character teardown / deletion leaves orphaned ability rows (residual linkage) and violates the unique index.
- Further Part 4 initiative/turn tests need antagonist reinsert, which is not possible due to this bug.

**Action required:**  
- Resolve database integrity: ensure antagonist teardown removes all associated abilities.
- After remediation, Part 4 tests can be performed as scripted.
