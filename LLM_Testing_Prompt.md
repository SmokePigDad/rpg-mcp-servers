# LLM Testing Prompt for RPG MCP Servers

## Your Mission
You are an expert QA tester for World of Darkness MCP servers. Your task is to systematically execute comprehensive test suites to verify that all 25+ tools work correctly according to their specifications.

## Test Environment Setup
You have access to two MCP servers:
- **game-state-server**: Handles persistent data (characters, inventory, world state)
- **combat-engine-server**: Handles dice mechanics and rule adjudications

## Testing Instructions

### Phase 1: Execute Test Blocks in Order
Execute the test blocks in the following sequence (dependencies matter):

#### üîß **Test Block 1: Character & Antagonist Management**
**Reference**: @`e:\Tinker\rpg-mcp-servers/TestBlock1_CharacterManagement.md`

**Focus**: Foundation systems - character creation, retrieval, updates
- Create characters for all 4 game lines (vampire, werewolf, mage, changeling)
- Test character retrieval by ID and name
- Verify character updates work correctly
- Create and manage antagonists from templates
- Test all validation scenarios (missing fields, duplicates, invalid data)

**Critical Success Criteria**: 
- At least one character of each game line created successfully
- Character retrieval works by both ID and name
- All validation tests properly reject invalid input

#### ‚ö° **Test Block 2: Resources & Progression**
**Reference**: @`e:\Tinker\rpg-mcp-servers/TestBlock2_ResourcesAndProgression.md`

**Focus**: Dynamic character state - resources, health, XP
- Test resource management (willpower, blood, rage, etc.) for each game line
- Apply different damage types and verify health tracking
- Award XP and test trait improvement with cost calculations
- Verify resource validation prevents overspending

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- Resource operations work for game-line specific resources
- Damage system properly tracks bashing/lethal/aggravated
- XP costs calculate correctly and trait improvements work

#### üéØ **Test Block 3: Status Effects & Inventory**
**Reference**: @`e:\Tinker\rpg-mcp-servers/TestBlock3_StatusEffectsAndInventory.md`

**Focus**: Temporary conditions and equipment management
- Apply, retrieve, and remove status effects on characters and NPCs
- Add, update, and remove inventory items
- Test mechanical effects storage and retrieval
- Verify data persistence and isolation

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- Status effects can be applied to both characters and antagonists
- Inventory operations work for all item types
- Effects and items persist correctly across operations

#### üé≤ **Test Block 4: Dice Mechanics**
**Reference**: @`e:\Tinker\rpg-mcp-servers/TestBlock4_DiceMechanics.md`

**Focus**: Core game mechanics and rule adjudications
- Test basic dice pools with specialty rules
- Verify contested actions and net success calculations
- Test soak and damage rolls for all damage types
- Execute game-line specific mechanics (frenzy, form changes, magick, cantrips)
- Test social combat system

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- Dice mechanics follow World of Darkness rules correctly
- Game-line specific tools work for each splat
- Social combat provides meaningful results

#### üåç **Test Block 5: World State & Initiative**
**Reference**: @`e:\Tinker\rpg-mcp-servers/TestBlock5_WorldStateAndInitiative.md`

**Focus**: Game state persistence and combat management
- Save and retrieve world state with complex data
- Log story progress over time
- Set up and manage initiative order for combat scenes
- Test turn advancement and round cycling
- Verify cross-server integration for combat engine tools

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- World state and story progress persist correctly
- Initiative system handles multiple concurrent scenes
- Turn management cycles properly through rounds

### Phase 2: Execution Guidelines

#### For Each Test Block:
1. **Read the entire test block** before starting
2. **Execute tests in the order listed** (some tests depend on previous results)
3. **Record actual results** for each test case
4. **Note any deviations** from expected outcomes
5. **Capture error messages** exactly as they appear
6. **Track test data** (character IDs, item IDs, effect IDs) for use in subsequent tests

#### Test Execution Format:
For each test, provide:
```
**Test X.Y: [Test Name]**
- Input: [exact input used]
- Expected: [expected result]
- Actual: [actual result]
- Status: ‚úÖ PASS / ‚ùå FAIL / ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- Notes: [any observations or issues]
```

#### Critical Data Tracking:
Maintain a reference sheet of:
- Character IDs for each game line
- Antagonist IDs created
- Item IDs in inventories
- Status effect IDs applied
- Scene IDs for combat testing

### Phase 3: Reporting Requirements

#### Summary Report Format:
```
## Test Execution Summary

### Overall Results:
- **Total Tests**: X
- **Passed**: Y (Z%)
- **Failed**: A (B%)
- **Partial**: C (D%)

### Test Block Results:
- Block 1 (Character Management): X/Y passed
- Block 2 (Resources & Progression): X/Y passed  
- Block 3 (Status Effects & Inventory): X/Y passed
- Block 4 (Dice Mechanics): X/Y passed
- Block 5 (World State & Initiative): X/Y passed

### Critical Issues Found:
[List any major bugs or failures]

### Recommendations:
[Suggest fixes or improvements]
```

#### Detailed Findings:
For each failed test, provide:
- Exact error message or unexpected behavior
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Impact assessment (critical/major/minor)
- Suggested fix if obvious

### Phase 4: Special Focus Areas

#### Validation Testing:
Pay special attention to:
- Input validation (missing fields, wrong types, invalid values)
- Constraint enforcement (unique names, resource limits)
- Error message clarity and consistency

#### Integration Testing:
Verify:
- Data persistence across operations
- Cross-server communication (combat engine ‚Üí game state)
- Isolation between different entities (characters, scenes, etc.)

#### Edge Cases:
Test boundary conditions:
- Zero/negative values where applicable
- Maximum values and overflow scenarios
- Empty states and missing data

## Success Criteria for Complete Test Suite

### Minimum Acceptable Results:
- **90%+ pass rate** across all test blocks
- **All character creation tests pass** (foundation requirement)
- **All dice mechanics work correctly** (core gameplay requirement)
- **No critical data loss or corruption** observed

### Ideal Results:
- **95%+ pass rate** with only minor issues
- **All validation tests work correctly**
- **All game-line specific features functional**
- **Clean error handling** for all edge cases

## Final Deliverable
Provide a comprehensive test report that includes:
1. Executive summary with pass/fail statistics
2. Detailed results for each test block
3. List of all issues found with severity ratings
4. Recommendations for fixes and improvements
5. Assessment of production readiness

**Begin testing with Test Block 1 and work through each block systematically. Good luck!**
