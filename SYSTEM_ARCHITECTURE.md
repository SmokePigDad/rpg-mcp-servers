# SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

## Overview

This project implements an extensible, modular World of Darkness Model Context Protocol (MCP) engine using a **two-server model**:

- **game-state-server**: Handles persistent data, database operations, character/NPC state management, antagonist creation, resource tracking, and more.
- **combat-engine-server**: Implements game mechanic and combat tools, dice pool rolling, contest adjudication, and splat-specific special mechanics (e.g., Vampire Frenzy, Mage magick).

The servers coordinate via API tool calls and protocol messages, enabling robust multi-splat support and future extensibility.

## Database Schema

### Core Player Character Table
- `characters`: ID, name, concept, game_line, **attributes** (strength, dex, etc.), health, willpower, experience, etc.

### Modular Trait Tables (per splat)
- `character_vampire_traits`: clan, generation, blood_pool, humanity, etc.
- `character_werewolf_traits`: breed, auspice, tribe, gnosis, rage, renown, etc.
- `character_mage_traits`: tradition_convention, arete, quintessence, paradox
- `character_changeling_traits`: kith, seeming, glamour, banality

### Antagonists/NPCs
- `npcs`: matches core schema of `characters` (game_line, traits, stats).
- Modular splat tables mirror the ones above for NPCs: e.g., `npc_vampire_traits`, etc.

### Relational / Supporting Tables
- `character_abilities`, `character_disciplines`, `character_arts`, `character_realms`, `character_gifts`, `character_spheres`, `xp_ledger`, `derangements`, `inventory`, etc.

## Example Combat Turn Sequence

1. **Storyteller** calls `get_current_turn` (to see whose turn it is)
2. **AI/NPC/Player** acts; action is narrated
3. **AI** calls `roll_wod_pool` for action (attack, power, etc.)
4. **AI** calls `roll_damage_pool` if attack is successful
5. **AI** calls `apply_damage` with damage results
6. **AI** calls `advance_turn` to move to next participant

At each step, MCP tools ensure the correct rules, initiative order, and health tracking are applied, automatically adapting to the current splat and game context.

---

## Expansion

The MCP system is designed for future extensibility: add new splats, modular trait tables, antagonist templates, and tools as desired.
### Initiative & Turn Management Workflow

The system uses an explicit, stateful turn-tracking model. The correct sequence to begin and run a combat scene is as follows:

1.  **Set the Order**: Call `set_initiative` once at the start of combat with the list of all combatants and their initiative scores.
2.  **Start Combat**: Call `advance_turn` **once** to officially begin the combat and move the turn to the actor with the first turn order.
3.  **Get Current Actor**: Call `get_current_turn` to see whose turn it is.
4.  **Resolve Action**: The current actor takes their action (e.g., calls `roll_wod_pool`, `apply_damage`).
5.  **Advance to Next Actor**: Call `advance_turn` again to end the current turn and proceed to the next actor in the order.
6.  Repeat steps 3-5 until combat ends.
