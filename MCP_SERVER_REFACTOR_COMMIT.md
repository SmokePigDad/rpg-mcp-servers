## **MCP Server Overhaul: Summary of Completed Refactor**

This document summarizes the completed overhaul and refactor of the MCP server codebase.

### **Phase 0: Project Cleanup & Preparation**
Legacy and redundant files were removed to streamline and clarify the project structure. Old database modules, obsolete configuration files, and IDE-specific artifacts were deleted or excluded from version control, improving maintainability and eliminating sources of confusion.

### **Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes**
Major blocking bugs affecting the MCP integration and server operations were resolved. Tool discovery and exposure issues in the game-state server were fixed, database templates and handlers were corrected to prevent runtime errors, and persistence mechanisms for world state and story progress were made robust and reliable.

### **Phase 2: Code Refactoring and Improvement**
Code quality was enhanced by refactoring core logic into a service/repository pattern, improving testability and separation of concerns. Handler logic was simplified, laying the groundwork for further modularization across all core server features.

### **Phase 3: Changeling: The Dreaming Implementation**
Support for Changeling-specific mechanics and tools (such as the `invoke_cantrip` feature) was implemented and integrated. All relevant data handling and character logic were updated to fully support these game line requirements.

These changes collectively improved stability, maintainability, and extensibility for ongoing development.
