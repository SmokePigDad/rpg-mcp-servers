# Test Block 1: Character & Antagonist Management – RESULTS

## Summary
Automated QA could not execute test cases for character and antagonist management because all relevant tool handlers (except "spend_xp") are not registered with the MCP dispatcher in [`game-state-server/src/index.ts`](game-state-server/src/index.ts). As a result, calls to tools such as `create_character`, `get_character`, and others return "❌ Unknown tool request." despite the tools being defined and advertised.

## Test Results

**Test 1.1: Standard Character Creation**
- Input: `{ "name": "TestVampire_1", "game_line": "vampire", "concept": "Neonate", "clan": "Brujah" }`
- Expected: Character created successfully with ID returned
- Actual: ❌ Unknown tool request.
- Status: ❌ FAIL
- Notes: Handler for `create_character` is not implemented in MCP tool dispatcher.

**Test 1.2–1.21**  
_All subsequent tests requiring character or antagonist operations depend on registered tool handlers. Each fails with the same root cause and response._

---

## Critical Issue

**No operational MCP handlers for core tools.**  
- Only `spend_xp` is handled.
- All foundational CRUD and retrieval tools for characters and antagonists are missing dispatcher mappings.
- No further functional testing for Test Block 1 is possible until this is resolved.

---

## Recommendations

**Implement and register all required tool handlers** (see `toolDefinitions` array) to the MCP dispatcher in [`game-state-server/src/index.ts`](game-state-server/src/index.ts). Example:
```js
toolDispatcher['create_character'] = create_character_handler
toolDispatcher['get_character'] = get_character_handler
// ...etc for all tools in toolDefinitions
```
Each handler should follow the required signature and update the dispatcher object at startup.

**Re-run this QA block** once those handlers are wired up to verify expected/actual behavior.
