# ü¶á MCP Servers ‚Äì Old World of Darkness (Storyteller System) Automation Suite

**Advanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for AI-powered Storyteller System play.** Automate, adjudicate, and manage classic ("oWoD") World of Darkness games: Vampire: the Masquerade, Werewolf: the Apocalypse, Mage: the Ascension, Changeling: the Dreaming, and more.

## üé≤ What is This?

This suite empowers digital play, AI storytelling, and character management for classic World of Darkness settings‚Äîintegrating rules knowledge, dice pools, resource tracking, combat, and persistent world state. Features include:

- Automated character (PC/NPC) creation and full stat management
- Persistent chronicles: health, willpower, Virtues, supernatural traits
- Status effect and antagonist management
- Extended support for all major oWoD "splats" (Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, Changeling)
- Tactical features: initiative, status effects, and narrative-driven scene tools
- API exposes tools as callable endpoints for AI DM/storyteller, custom UIs, or game integration

## üî• Latest Major Updates

- **ASCII Battlefield Visualization**: Render spatial combat/narrative scenes using gridded ASCII maps for any Storyteller line.
- **Shared 3rd Edition Dice Pool System**: Handles dice pool rolls, Virtue checks, contested actions, soak, and resource spends.
- **Full health/resource engine**: Supports Bruised‚ÄìMauled track, willpower, blood/Gnosis/Glamour/Quintessence.
- **Modular Splat Features**: Each game line exposes traits, resources, and mechanics (Frenzy, Magick, Rage, etc.).
