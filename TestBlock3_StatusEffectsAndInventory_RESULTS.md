# Test Block 3: Status Effects & Inventory Management – RESULTS

## Summary
Automated QA could not execute any status effect or inventory management test cases because all required MCP tool handlers (`apply_status_effect`, `remove_status_effect`, `get_status_effects`, `add_item`, `get_inventory`, `update_item`, `remove_item`) are missing dispatcher registration in [`game-state-server/src/index.ts`](game-state-server/src/index.ts). All attempts produce

```
❌ Unknown tool request.
```

Block 3 is also fully dependent on characters and antagonists being creatable and present—which failed in Block 1.

---

## Test Results

_All 30 status/inventory tests in this block fail for the dispatcher root cause described above._

---

## Critical Issue

_No operational MCP handlers for any tools in this block._

---

## Recommendations

**Implement and register all required tool handlers in the tool dispatcher.**
- Re-run this QA block after fixing handler registration and confirming dependencies from Blocks 1–2 are passing.
